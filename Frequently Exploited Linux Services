Linux is a free and open source OS that is comprised of the Linux kernel which is a collection of software and utilities.

Linux has various use cases, however, it is typically deployed as a server OS. For this reason, there are specific services and protocols that will typically be found running on a Linux server.

These services provide an attacker with an access vector that they can utilize to gain access to a target host.

Some frequently exploited Linux services:
  Apache Web Server/TCP ports 80,443
  SSH/TCP port 22
  FTP/TCP port 21
  SAMBA/TCP port 445 (Linux implementation of SMB, allows Windows to access Linux shares)
