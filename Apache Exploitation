/phpinfo.php is a good directory to browse for version info
Looking at what API it is using you can also use searchsploit
for example searchsploit php cgi (in this example we use CGI argument injection)
**Ensure to verify if it runs in pyhton2 or 3 etc**
For this specific .py exploit we need to change pwn_code to a php reverse one liner in between """<?php<yourcode>?>"""
ensure to add your ip to the php reverse code where need
**If you dont get a shell change the <&3 to <&4 in the pwn_code and retry
once you get a reverse shell you can type /bin/bash -i 
ls -al
